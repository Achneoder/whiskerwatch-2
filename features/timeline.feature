Feature: Campaign timeline view
  As a game master
  I want a chronological feed of sessions, completed beats, and faction clock changes
  So that I can answer questions like "when did the Owl Bridge toll go up?" without digging through every screen

  Background:
    Given I open Whiskerwatch

  Scenario: Completing a beat and bumping a faction clock both show up on the Timeline
    When I navigate to the "Adventure" screen
    And the GM adds a beat titled "Find the tunnel entrance" to "The granary raid"
    And the GM completes the "Find the tunnel entrance" beat
    And I start a live session
    And the GM bumps "The Gnawing Court"'s faction clock
    And the GM exits the live session
    And I navigate to the "Timeline" screen
    Then I should see "Beat completed: Find the tunnel entrance" in the timeline
    And I should see "The Gnawing Court clock: 3 — 4" in the timeline
